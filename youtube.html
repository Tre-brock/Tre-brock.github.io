<title>Tre_brock on youtube</title>
<h1>I don't like youtube but there isn't a great alternitive.</h1>
<p>I use youtube often, but it tracks users, has ads and constantly adds thing like shorts, games, etc. It would be great If I could use something like <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/browse-content">peertube</a>, but not all the creators I watch are on there so it is not viable for me (yet!). If you are a crator you can easily sync your channel. Currently I use Invidious to watch youtube and it's almost perfect, but youtube is constantly trying to kill it and I can't comment, but that's a trade of I was willing to take. Overall I wish more creators were on peertube but I can live like it is now because of frontends.</p>
